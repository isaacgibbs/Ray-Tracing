# Ray-Tracing
Ray tracing applicaton built from the ground up. This program has a variety of generic objects including a 'portal' object that allows rays to pass through one disc and out of the paired disc.  

The scene initially configured after downloading the program requires two texture files. I do not take credit for any of these art assets and 
the program can be used with alternative creatives to get different results if desired.

After downloading the above assets or any assets desired to be implemented by a ray tracing object. Copy the images to the same directory as the program's .cs files.
